Online advertising platforms often face a common challenge: the cold start problem. Insufficient behavioral data (clicks) makes accurate click-through rate (CTR) forecasting of new ads challenging. CTR for "old" items can also be significantly underestimated due to their early performance influencing their long-term behavior on the platform.
The cold start problem has far-reaching implications for businesses, including missed long-term revenue opportunities. To mitigate this issue, we developed a UCB-like algorithm under multi-armed bandit (MAB) setting for positional-based model (PBM), specifically tailored to auction pay-per-click systems.
Our proposed algorithm successfully combines theory and practice: we obtain theoretical upper estimates of budget regret, and conduct a series of experiments on synthetic and real-world data that confirm the applicability of the method on the real platform.
In addition to increasing the platform's long-term profitability, we also propose a mechanism for maintaining short-term profits through controlled exploration and exploitation of items.
